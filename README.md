# Symmetric Multiprocessing using MESI Protocol
Dual-core cache coherence system implementing the MESI (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid) protocol in SystemVerilog. Includes two direct-mapped 512KB caches with 2-word block size, write-back policy, and write-invalidate mechanism. Project for high-speed multiprocessor system design.
